## The Luck of the Irish
> I have been assured [...] that a young healthy child, well nursed, is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricasee, or a ragoust.

Jonathan Swift's _A Modest Proposal_ (available on [WikiSource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_9/A_Modest_Proposal)) is a satirical hyperbole which mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor (who were predominantly Irish Catholic), as well as British policy towards the Irish in general. The history of the Irish people is both long and complicated, but what must be remembered is that for the longest time, the Irish people were a disadvantaged minority.

Thus, I thought it might be interesting to look at how the Irish described themselves in Anglophone literature. Or, in Anglophone spheres in general. Preferably, I would look at the frequency of words used and then sort them by descriptive relevance. (Descriptive words would be tagged either _positive_ (+1), _negative_ (-1), or _neutral_ (0).) 

* For the 1700s, I believe it would be interesting to look at the works of Jonathan Swift. Besides _A Modest Proposal_, I would also like to look at  _A Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture_ (available on [WikiSource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Works_of_the_Rev._Jonathan_Swift/Volume_9/A_Proposal_for_the_Universal_Use_of_Irish_Manufacture)) and the _Drapier's Letters_ (available on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12784/12784-h/12784-h.htm)).
* For the 19th century, I would like to look at the works of William Carleton, who famously wrote a two-volume collection of sketches called _Traits and Stories of the Irish Peasantry_.
* For the 20th century it would be interesting to look at the short story collection by a variety of Irish authors called _Humours of Irish Life_ (available on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/35891/pg35891-images.html)). 

**Or,** perhaps, it would be a more interesting idea to simply look at the works tagged as "Ireland -- Social life and customs -- Fiction" on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12784/12784-h/12784-h.htm).

* As literature has kind of shifted away from this type of writing, I am unsure if a 21th century example would be appropriate. However, I suppose it might be possible to use the EPIC dataset to look at Anglophone Irish sarcasm online:
> EPIC (English Perspectivist Irony Corpus) is a disaggregated English corpus for irony detection, containing 3,000 pairs of short conversations (posts-replies) from Twitter and Reddit, along with the demographic information of each annotator (age, nationality, gender, and so on).
-- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Multilingual-Perspectivist-NLU/EPIC)

By looking at the frequency of words used -- specifically descriptive words -- I would like to examine if there is a trend in how Irish Anglophone authors, and the Irish people in general, present themselves.
